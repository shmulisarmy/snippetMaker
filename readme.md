# Snippet Maker

this project is an automation tool that takes care 
of the snippet making process for you so can have 
more time to build your projects


just enter 
```sh
python3 main.py
```

to make a get started and the program will take over from there!!


any field thats shows up as optional you don't have to worry about
for example the name field you don't have to worry about because
if no name is provided then its automatically assigned a name (anonymous x)

this project even comes with a bonus Snippet Maker snippet which is exactly what it sounds like

# How You Can Contribute

- [making gui]
- [add a feature that checks if the name field is already the name of another snippet in the file to avoid overriding original and handles this]
